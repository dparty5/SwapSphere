# SwapSphere

Here is the server part of the SwapSphere application.

SwapSphere is an innovative mobile app that will provide a convenient platform for people to exchange things. With it, users will be able to freely exchange items they no longer need and find new things that match their needs and interests.

The main goal of SwapSphere is to create a community where users can share their belongings, make new connections, and find mutually beneficial exchanges. The app will feature a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily upload photos and descriptions of their items, indicate their value, and accept offers from other members.

SwapSphere also provides a chat feature that allows users to communicate and negotiate exchange details. This is handy for discussing terms, coordinating meeting times and locations, or exchanging mail delivery.

Security and trust are priority aspects of SwapSphere. Users can create profiles with detailed information about themselves, including a photo and ratings from other members. Reviews and ratings help users make informed decisions about who they want to share with. In addition, the app has mechanisms for dealing with possible conflicts or problems that may arise during the sharing process.

SwapSphere is not only a platform for sharing things, but also an opportunity to do something good for the environment. Reusing and redistributing things helps reduce waste
